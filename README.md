üìÇ Folder Structure

chapter-01/, chapter-02/, ‚Ä¶
Each folder corresponds to a chapter in the book. Inside you‚Äôll find the code snippets that appeared in that chapter.

snippet-XXX.nim
Standard Nim source files. Most of the examples in this book are written in Nim.

snippet-XXX.yml
YAML configuration files (often for GitHub Actions or CI pipelines).

snippet-XXX.toml
TOML configuration files (e.g., nimble package definitions).

snippet-XXX.json
JSON data files used in examples.

snippet-XXX.sh
Shell script examples (build scripts, environment setup).

snippet-XXX-Dockerfile
Docker build definitions.

snippet-XXX-Makefile
Makefile examples for automation.

MANIFEST.csv
A catalog listing all snippets with their chapter, snippet number, filename, and the first line of code.

üîé How Files Were Extracted

Code blocks were detected based on formatting (monospace text, indentation, and keywords like proc, import, FROM, etc.).

Contiguous code-like paragraphs were grouped into one snippet.

File extensions were inferred from context:

Nim code ‚Üí .nim

Docker examples ‚Üí Dockerfile

Makefiles ‚Üí Makefile

YAML/TOML/JSON ‚Üí respective formats

Shell commands ‚Üí .sh

Unknown ‚Üí .txt

üóÇ How to Use

Browse to the chapter folder you‚Äôre interested in.

Open the snippet files directly in your text editor or IDE.

Use MANIFEST.csv to quickly search for examples (e.g., by keyword in the first line).

You can run the Nim files with the Nim compiler, or adapt the config files for your own environment.
